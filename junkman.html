<u><font color= "#800080">Scene:</u> The Piazza, which is on a tourist island somewhere on the Mediterranean. On one side of the square there is a ramshackle cafe, on the opposite side is the Junkman's stall.
Central to the square there is an archway entrance to the piazza. The Junkman is dozing quietly behind his stall as the tourist enters through the archway. He moves towards the stall and picks up one of the items displayed on it</font color="#FF0000"></i></u><p>


<font color="#0000FF">The Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">(Rather drowsily) 4O<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> ( rather surprised) I beg your pardon?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">40. The statuette you are holding is 40<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Oh, oh I see. I was just looking really<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">He who hesitates is lost. You should snap it up quickly before it is sold to someone else<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Ah yes of course but let me at least think about it for a moment or two<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">As you wish.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> I wonder, could you tell me when the cafe opens<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Maybe 5pm. Claude does not keep strict hours<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Claude? <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Yes the cafe owner<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, 5pm is not too long to wait. I am very hungry though. Is the food good there?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> No, it's terrible<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Oh dear. The hotel I am staying at unfortunately does not serve food<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">You must be staying at the Hotel Metropole<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Yes I am.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">(in a rush) Here are your coffee and rolls Pedro. Drink your coffee before it gets cold<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Hello Claude. Pleased to meet you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Who the devil are you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">This is Toby Claude. He is hoping to eat in your illustrious cafe this evening so perhaps you should treat him a little more politely<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">I am always polite but I do not like his over familiarity<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Perhaps you can see Toby, why the cafe is usually empty.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">I don't do so badly. It is a quiet time of year<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Anytime of year is quiet for you Claude<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> You don't seem to be very nice to Claude considering he just bought rolls and coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> It is a curious situation Toby. I hate Claude but Claude adores me but hates Sasha, who I love but she hates me but loves Claude<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Yes that is rather curious.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Ahh and here is Rula. She hates Everyone.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> (Angrily) I hate nobody! Except that Pig Claude<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Now, now Rula. Calm down.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN he says.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Look my dear whatever the problem is we can sort it out. I will make you a new offer.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> I spit on your offer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">I haven't made it yet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">Whatever it is I spit on it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> I had no idea Rula spat so much. I am glad I only have rolls and not soup<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">You seem very upset<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">And who is this moron<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Errr.... My name is Toby<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> Toby smobby, keep your nose out of our business.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">This is not the friendliest resort I have ever been to<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Luckily you have not caught us on a bad day<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">I came back to collect my suitcase. I quit<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Please, please Rula. Think it over.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">I have thought it over and I still quit. You are a rude, imbecilic moron that smells terrible and you could not run a business if your life depended on it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF">I can't help but agree.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Pedro, Pedro my friend, do not take her side<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">You do seem really angry Rula<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">That is because I am angry you idiot<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">I am sure we can sort something out.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> Men!!! You are all the same. When I worked in Paris I cooked meals fit for a king<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Maybe that's why they had the revolution<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">The men working there could not accept that a woman was such a great chef. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Why did they sack you then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> They did not sack me you disgusting old tramp. I left. With my held held high and my dignity intact. It is unbelievable. They were so jealous that even the waiters in the restaurant refused to eat the free meals that I cooked, they went elsewhere<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">As you say, unbelievable.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">So goodbye Claude I hope I never see you again you miserable excuse of a business man<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Please don't go my dear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">Nothing you can say will make me stay<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Rula, Rula just one moment (Quielty) Is it the wrong time of the month for you my dear?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula: </font color="#0000FF">(loudly) NO! It is the wrong time of the month for you. ( there is the sound of a face being slapped)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">That probably wasn't the best thing you could have said Claude<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> I have to get to work if I am to open today, eat your rolls.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> (Sadly) It seems the cafe maybe opening late today<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> It seems that way<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Is there anywhere else I can eat?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> No, so many places have closed since the recession started.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Toby: </font color="#0000FF">I cannot believe there is nowhere else at all in this town that serves food.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">That's the way it is. Nowhere else at all â€“ Apart from the Hotel Splendide<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">(Hopefully) The Hotel Splendide?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">They serve food?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Oh yes, the finest food in the land.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> And it is open now?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Yes, 24 hours a day<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Then why the devil didn't you tell me before. I will go there right now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> There would be no point<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Because you are staying at the Hotel Metropole<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">That is true but surely they will serve me dinner?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> I am afraid they won't. You have to be staying at the hotel to eat there.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">No problem I will Sign out of the Metropole and move to the Splendide<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> That won't work either<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">They feel that anyone that books into the Metropole has no loyalty to them so they would not let you book in there.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">This is incredulous! No loyalty? It is a hotel not the French Foreign legion<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">It is the way of this small island<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Unbelievable.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> (Excitedley)Ahh Pasha, Pasha you wondrous being, how you make my heart race when you appear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Shut up you dirty, disgusting, smelly old man.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Even your insults drip like diamonds from your lips<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">I don't want to hear another word from you. You disgust me. I haven't see you here before, who are you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Ah good evening, My name is Toby<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> ( In a sultry voice) Pleased to meet you Toby<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Pleased to meet you too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">My name is Pasha, I errr.. well I work in this piazza<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Oh I see. In the cafe?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Unfortunately not. Although I would if I had the chance. Claude is such a charming man<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Are we talking about the Claude that I know?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Shut up pig<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">I am hoping to eat there when he opens<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Rula Just quit.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh really, maybe Claude will let me work there now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Of course he won't, he hates you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Nobody asked you!   -   Toby, do you have a cigarette please<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Ahh no, sorry, I don't smoke<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> (With disappointment) Nobody smokes these days. They are all afraid of dying. For some reason they think it will be worse than living.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> Ahhh What in interesting little gathering we have here<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Not that interesting really<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> I see you are not dead yet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Not yet. Still time before the sun sets though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police chief: </font color="#0000FF">Trying to be to clever will be the death of you one day<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Unlikely, stupidity might be though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">And how about you my dear how are you faring today?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">So so<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> Only so so? I am sure that you can do better than that. Is this a new client of yours?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Err no, not at all. I am just waiting to eat at the cafe<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">I see he is still closed, I came by to get my coffee. I don't like it when I have to wait<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Rula Just quit so the poor man has problems<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">His problems, not mine. I will continue my patrol now. When you see him tell him I was disappointed he did not have my coffee ready. Very disappointed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Life is full of disappointments<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">You should know old man. - I will return later.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">How I hate that man<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">He certainly doesn't seem very pleasant<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> So, Mr Toby. Are you going to be my client as the police chief assumed<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Ahhm, I am not sure what you mean by your client<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Do you want to avail yourself to my services?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> (mystified) Services??<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">It is clear to see you are not a man of the world Toby<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Well I suppose I have led a somewhat quiet life<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Pasha my dear I think that Toby may be a little too innocent for the type of service you offer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Keep your nose out of my business pig<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> I am only trying to help<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">How can a smelly old man like you help. If he does not want my services that's fine. I'll starve tonight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh I am sorry, I do not want you to starve<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Don't concern yourself with me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">If you will only listen to me I may have an answer for you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF">(angry) What a mess she has made of that kitchen. I am well rid of her<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> (Just as Angry) Well rid of me are you Claude?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> Ah forgive me Rula, I am a little flusttered<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Rula:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't give a damn what you are. I forgot my suitcase. I will fetch that and then be gone<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">Are you sure you will not reconsider?<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Rula: </font color="#0000FF">Absolutely sure now out of my way you grubby little man<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> I really can't imagine what I have done to deserve all this<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> I can Claude<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Excuse me Claude, do you have any idea when you might open this evening?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> I have told you before not to be too familiar with me. I open when I open. That is all I can say<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Is there anything I can do to help you Claude?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> You??  - You?? There is nothing you can do to help me with anything you, you, you   - woman of the street<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> By the way Claude, the Police Chief passed through. He was very disappointed that you didn't have his coffee ready<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">Oh dear, dear, dear yes. I must get back to work<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">So what is your idea you miserable old man<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> It seems Toby does not deire any of your usual services, however, he is very keen to eat at the cafe. Perhaps he could hire you as his dinner guest<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Well maybe you are not as stupid as you look. That might work. How about it Toby?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> (A little flustered)  Ahhm. Yes, yes I suppose I couild do that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Good. My fee for that would be 20<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Do you agree Toby?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Well yes. But I don't have any cash at the moment. The ATM at the hotel was not working<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> It never works<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, so then it looks like I shall starve tonight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Oh please I really don't want you to starve but I can't see what I can do<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> I have an idea now. You could sell something?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Sell something?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Yes. This old goat doesn't just sell junk, he buys it too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't have any junk. I don't come on vacation with a case full of junk to sell in case I need to take someone to dinner<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> That tie you are wearing Toby. It looks like good quality silk. I will give you 20 for it
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">No, no I cannot sell that, it was a birthday gift from my mother<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok I will starve then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">(Exasperated) Don't make me feel so guilty. I don't want you to starve<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Don't feel guilty maybe I deserve to starve<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Ok I have an idea now<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">We are great ideas people<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">How about you lend me the 20 and you can hold on to the tie as security<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> I cannot do that I am afraid. I have no licence to lend money only buy and sell. If the Police Chief found out I had been lending money I would be in jail before you could blink<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">It was just a thought<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> What I could do though is to buy the ties from you then tomorrow when you can get some cash you can buy it back from me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Another good idea from the pig<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> well that seems to be the answer. Here is the tie<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> And here is the 20<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> And Pasha here is the 20 for you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha. </font color="#0000FF">Thank you. So tonight I will not starve. I get a free meal and 20 besides. Come Toby, there is a juke box in the cafe, lets go in and dance<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh no, no I really am not much of a dancer.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Nonsense, come take my hand and I will teach you to dance <p>
     ( There are a few moments silence)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> Still no coffee for me I see. This is a very sad state of affairs<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Claude has problems<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">His problems are really no concern of mine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">Nor mine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> That is a very fine tie you have on your stall. Normally all you have is a pitiful pile of junk<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">(a slight panic) It really is not as good as it looks, cheap silk copy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> It looks genuine to me. And a quite attractive pattern<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF">Oh that pattern is so last year, nobody wears that pattern any more. And really it is too wide to be fashionable Police Chief: You have been selling junk for too long. You no longer recognise quality. How much is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> I really wouldn't want you to waste your money on it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> You have aroused a suspicion in me. You seem very reluctant to sell it which makes me think perhaps you loaned money on it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">LOANED?  Oh no, no, no. I have no licence to loan.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">Precisely. Here is 20 for it and be grateful you are not in jail<p>
(Suddenly there is lots of excited shouting from Claude, Toby and Pasha)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude:</font color="#0000FF"> FITRE! FIRE! FIRE! Quick get water<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">The kitchen is on fire, the cafe is burning down<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">Help us put it out, it will burn to the ground<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">The fire service will take hours to get here, there is nothing you can do<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude </font color="#0000FF">but my cafe! My business, I will lose everything<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> I am so sorry Claude. We did try to put it out<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh my gosh! The cafe is almost gone already<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman: </font color="#0000FF">An old wooden building like that  had no chance in a fire<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Claude: </font color="#0000FF">(sobbing) What am I to do? What am I to do <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby: </font color="#0000FF">Hey that's my tie you are holding<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> No my tie<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> It wasn't for sale<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> Ah so money was loaned against it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Junkman:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh no!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> I am calling for reinforcements<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Toby:</font color="#0000FF"> Reinforcements? Why<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief: </font color="#0000FF">He, is under arrest for lending money without a licence, you are under arrest for loaning the goods, Claude is under arrest for polluting the atmosphere, and she is under arrest for being indecently dressed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Pasha: </font color="#0000FF">It wasn't my fault, my dress caught fire<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Police Chief:</font color="#0000FF"> Tell that to the judge, when you eventually get your trial. A successful day for me!<p>
